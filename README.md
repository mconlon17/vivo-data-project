# VIVO Data Project Tools

The VIVO Data Project is an effort by the UF CTSI for the UF Heath Science Center
top update 3,000 faculty profiles and provide basic processes and tools for keeping 
VIVO profiles current.

Currently, the project needs three tools:

1. A survey uploader.  The REDCap survey software will be used to gather data from faculty.
The data consists of educational background, research areas of interest and service to the
profession.  A tool is needed to take the data from the survey responses and update VIVO.
1. Photo uploader.  As paertr of the survey, faculty are asked to attach a photo.  The photo
needs to be uploaded to VIVO.
1. PubMed update.  This tools has already been written (see [Add PubMed](http://github.com/mconlon/vivo-add-pubmed) and
will be duplicated here to ease install of the data project tools (all in one place), and to facilitate the
on-going VIVO 1.6 upgrade.
